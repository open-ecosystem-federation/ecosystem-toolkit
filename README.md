# Open Ecosystem Federation - Ecosystem Toolkit

## Toolkit specifications and documentation

Our material is published via Github Pages : https://open-ecosystem-federation.github.io/ecosystem-toolkit/

## Ways of working

### Version control and branching strategy

We use Github.

Our branching strategy follows : https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

We use a 'main' branch in place of the 'master' branch.

We re-use feature branches to incorporate feedback, suggestions and evolve our toolkit and to review these sorts of changes.

We incorporate github project issue numbers in our feature branch names where there are associated issues e.g. '42-my-feature'.

### OEF core member contributors

Please reach out with features, suggestions or feedback in one of the following two ways:

* raise a ticket in the 'beta-planning' project on the oef-beta-planning repository and mention your colleagues so they are notified
* create a feature branch as per our branching strategy and if there is an associated ticket in the 'beta-planning' project please incorporate the issue number in the feature branch name e.g. '42-'

### Other interested parties

We are figuring this out - coming soon.
