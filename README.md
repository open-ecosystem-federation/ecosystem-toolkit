# Open Ecosystem Federation - Ecosystem Toolkit

## Toolkit specifications and documentation

Our material is published via Github Pages : https://open-ecosystem-federation.github.io/ecosystem-toolkit/

## Ways of working

### Version control, branching strategy and releases

We use Github.

We use [A Successful Branching Model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for our branching strategy.

We use a 'main' branch in place of the 'master' branch.

We re-use feature branches to incorporate feedback, suggestions and evolve our toolkit and review these sorts of changes via pull requests.

We incorporate github project issue numbers in our feature branch names where there are associated issues e.g. '42-my-feature'.

We use [Chronver](https://chronver.org) for our tag/release versioning, for anything else just use the git commit :-)

### OEF core member contributors

Please reach out with features, suggestions or feedback in one of the following two ways:

* raise a ticket in the 'beta-planning' project on the oef-beta-planning repository and mention your colleagues so they are notified
* create a feature branch as per our branching strategy and if there is an associated ticket in the 'beta-planning' project please incorporate the issue number in the feature branch name e.g. '42-'

### Other interested parties

We are figuring this out - coming soon.
