# Ecosystem Toolkit

OEF will deliver an open, scalable, extensible and repeatable Ecosystem Toolkit comprising two parts:

* A technical specification based on open standards (coming soon)
* [Rules of Engagement](rules-of-engagement.md) A default governance framework

Parties use their implementation of the OEF technical specification to declare both the signals that they control and the basis on which they will share them with other OEF compliant implementations.

The signals capture the reasoning that a party has derived from - or the value they have added to - the information that is available to them about a particular domain of interest.

Distinct ecosystems emerge when OEF compliant implementations collaborate around a common domain of interest, in line with either the default governance framework or a bespoke governance model that builds on top of the default framework, to share signals.
